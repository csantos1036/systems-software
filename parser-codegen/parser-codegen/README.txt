These files:
	lex.c
	parser.c
	vm.c
	driver.c
	compiler.h
	Makefile
are an example of having multiple files for your homework 3. They are just
a suggestion. You should definitely edit them for your own implementation.
driver.c contains some code for implementing command line arguments which 
you can use for compiler directives.

To compile: 	$ make
To run: 	$ ./a.out <input file name> <directives>
